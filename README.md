My work spans from deep learning in high-energy physics (charged Higgs boson searches at the LHC) to building production-ready pipelines for LLM fine-tuning.  

## 🔭 What I’m Working On  
- Deep neural network models for high-energy physics event classification  
- Scalable pipelines for LLM fine-tuning and deployment  
- Side projects in AI, app development, and automation  

## 📂 Featured Projects  
- **[New Particles Detection](https://github.com/illoonego/charged-higgs-dnn-search)** – Deep learning–based search for charged Higgs boson at the LHC using PyTorch  
- **[Email Classification Agent](https://github.com/illoonego/gemma-finetune-emails)** – LoRA fine-tuning pipeline for email intent classification with Gemma-2B  
- **[Industrial Failure Prediction](https://github.com/illoonego/industrial-failure-prediction)** – XGBoost pipeline with SMOTE for predictive maintenance on imbalanced sensor data
